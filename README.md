 All work developed

The gym is embarking on a transformative journey to enhance its operations and member experience. This includes the implementation of a mobile application to regulate member access, gain insights into teacher performance, and discern the popularity of different classes. Furthermore, the gym aims to comprehensively digitize its operations, as its current technology infrastructure is virtually non-existent.

# Project Requirements
The gym's requirements include:

1. A Dataverse-Powered Database: Establish a robust Dataverse-based database to efficiently store student information, teacher profiles, class details, and real-time gym occupancy.

2. User-Friendly Gym App: Develop a user-friendly mobile application that serves as an interface within the gym. This app enables students to log in, select their desired classes, and manage their gym attendance seamlessly.

3. Automated Email Notifications: Implement an automated email notification system to communicate with students under specific conditions: a) when a user achieves a milestone of 100 consecutive gym visits and b) when a user misses two consecutive days of gym attendance.

4. Comprehensive Data Analytics: Create a data analytics system that aggregates and analyzes data collected from the app, providing valuable insights to help optimize gym operations and improve the overall experience for students.


# Second Part
After a great success with the app the company asked the team to create a website that contained a chatbot! Also the company needed help to choose a new location, product to sell and what new sport to add.

# Project Requirements
To address the challenges faced by the gym, we have implemented the following solutions:

An outside facing website: Develop a user-friendly website that serves as an outside face for the gym. This app enables students to enroll, check the classes.

Chatbot: A chatbit that helps students to navigate the world of power lift!

Market Reasearch: Create a data analytics research that helps to answer the following questions: 1) where to open the new gym?; 2) what to sell in the gym?; 3) what modality should we include?.
